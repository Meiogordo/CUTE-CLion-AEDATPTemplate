# CUTE for CLion for AEDA TPs Template
This is a template project that allows the use of CUTE in CLion projects easily, in preparation for AEDA TP classes.

## Aim
You can simply clone the repo and use the template project out of the box, but the main aim of this is to allow easy creation of several similar projects that share the same base template.

## How to use
To use the shell script you need only do `./generateTPProject.sh <TPNumber>`.
For example, `./generateTPProject.sh 2` would generate a project folder called AEDA-TP2, with all the internal dependencies correctly renamed and working out of the box.

## Credits
This project came in sequence to reading the instructions in [NIAEFEUP's cute-clion repo](https://github.com/NIAEFEUP/cute-clion). So, a shout-out to that repo for giving me the knowledge and idea to create this simple script :)

## Version of used programs:
 - CUTE Standalone v2.0.0
 - CLion 2017.2.1
